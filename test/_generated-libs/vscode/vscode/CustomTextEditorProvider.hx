	Provider for text based custom editors.
	
	Text based custom editors use a [`TextDocument`](#TextDocument) as their data model. This considerably simplifies
	implementing a custom editor as it allows VS Code to handle many common operations such as
	undo and backup. The provider is responsible for synchronizing text changes between the webview and the `TextDocument`.

		To resolve a custom editor, the provider must fill in its initial html content and hook up all
		the event listeners it is interested it. The provider can also hold onto the `WebviewPanel` to use later,
		for example in a command. See [`WebviewPanel`](#WebviewPanel) for additional details.
